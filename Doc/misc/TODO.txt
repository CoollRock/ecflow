JIRA ISSUES:
ECFLOW-136 Label, event. meter child commands persisting if node not found in server
  -> excessive label commands appear to cause client to hang/suspend
  -> top suggested show that most of process are in state 'D' UN-interable sleep (This is typically I/O related)
  -> it was a gpfs/file which causes page faulting > 500 simulataneos client
  
 
Client 
/////////1/////////2/////////3/////////4/////////5/////////6/////////7/////////8
        
    o Test for file-system full, this may be a common problems. hence Guard
      1/ ECF_HOME is full, ie handling, check-pt file, and log file
      2/ Jobs. Job file generation and job-output file full.
         i.e Abort task, and provide a reason ?         
    o (optional) auto-migrate ( Check dependencies on removed nodes and warn ) 
    o (optional) auto-restore ( Check dependencies on removed nodes and warn )
    o (optional) structure logging of commands such that its allows commands 
                 to be replayed on client side 
                                              
Server  
/////////1/////////2/////////3/////////4/////////5/////////6/////////7/////////8
                 
    o autorestore
    o automigrate

o Test case for portable binary archive bug on AIX: Michael Wong, Robert Ramey:

o Parser expression:
//    exprMap["../obs:YMD ge  ( (19720101 + 6576) - (12 + 1) )"] = std::make_pair(AstGreaterEqual::stype(),true);

o Size of full defs, returned to client keeps on growing ????
  Data specific, small defs does not show problem.
  This is partly accounted for by:
   - Task process id:
   - Task password
  
o deployment plan
    - testing with operations( client, server, xcdp, python ), Automake
    - migration
      ( ? )
