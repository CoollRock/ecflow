JIRA ISSUES:
==============================================================================================
ECFLOW-136 Label, event. meter child commands persisting if node not found in server
    -> excessive label commands appear to cause client to hang/suspend
    -> top suggested show that most of process are in state 'D' UN-interable sleep (This is typically I/O related)
    -> it was a gpfs/file which causes page faulting > 500 simulataneos client
  
ECFLOW-534 log hostname for ecflow_client users commands
    -> This really needs an IPC change since we need log the hostname where the command. is sent from
    -> At the moment only the user name is sent.
    -> Could combine string with <user>@<hostname>
    -> But then every user command will need to split out the user, needed in the log, AND for authentication.
 
ECFLOW-608 zombie handling.
    -> may need change in IPC, however should be ok, restricted child commands and server.
 
Client 
/////////1/////////2/////////3/////////4/////////5/////////6/////////7/////////8
        
    o Test for file-system full, this may be a common problems. hence Guard
      1/ ECF_HOME is full, ie handling, check-pt file, and log file
      2/ Jobs. Job file generation and job-output file full.
         i.e Abort task, and provide a reason ?         
    o (optional) auto-migrate ( Check dependencies on removed nodes and warn ) 
    o (optional) auto-restore ( Check dependencies on removed nodes and warn )
    o (optional) structure logging of commands such that its allows commands 
                 to be replayed on client side

o Parser expression:
//    exprMap["../obs:YMD ge  ( (19720101 + 6576) - (12 + 1) )"] = std::make_pair(AstGreaterEqual::stype(),true);

o Size of full defs, returned to client keeps on growing ????
  Data specific, small defs does not show problem.
  This is partly accounted for by:
   - Task process id:
   - Task password
