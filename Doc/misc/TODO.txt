JIRA ISSUES:
==============================================================================================
ECFLOW-136 Label, event. meter child commands persisting if node not found in server
    -> excessive label commands appear to cause client to hang/suspend
    -> top suggested show that most of process are in state 'D' UN-interable sleep (This is typically I/O related)
    -> it was a gpfs/file which causes page faulting > 500 simulataneos client
  
IPC Changes required
==============================================================================================
ECFLOW-534 log hostname for ecflow_client users commands
    -> This really needs an IPC change since we need log the hostname where the command. is sent from
    -> At the moment only the user name is sent.
    -> Could combine string with <user>@<hostname>
    -> But then every user command will need to split out the user, needed in the log, AND for authentication.
 
ECFLOW-608 zombie handling.
    -> may need change in IPC, however should be ok, restricted child commands and server.
 
ECFLOW-631 why command should force calendar to sync.
    -> the Why command can be out of sync since the suite calendar. See: Suite::collateChanges
       The suite calendar is only correctly sync'ed if there was a change in the server.
       We really need an equivalent to sync_clock(aka, sync_local), this should be called
       before the why command.
       However this requires an API change.
       
       class CSyncCmd : public UserCmd {
        public:
          enum Api { NEWS, SYNC , SYNC_FULL, CLOCK};
          
       The work around is suspend/resume to force a change change, and then call why command.
       
- Stats- If new command added stats command needs to be changed.

    o Test for file-system full, this may be a common problems. hence Guard
      1/ ECF_HOME is full, ie handling, check-pt file, and log file
      2/ Jobs. Job file generation and job-output file full.
         i.e Abort task, and provide a reason ?         
    o (optional) auto-migrate ( Check dependencies on removed nodes and warn ) 
    o (optional) auto-restore ( Check dependencies on removed nodes and warn )
    o (optional) structure logging of commands such that its allows commands 
                 to be replayed on client side

o Update replace
  currently the definition file, sent to server could include hundreds of suites
  We should prune the suites, that do not take part in the replace. *****
