 VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT:
 Pre-announce release, because:
   a/ User support need to set up the modules on AIX
   b/ Daniel needs to pre-test it works on all other linux flavours
   c/ For those people who use current LINK, will be hosed
      They need warning and chance to prepare
   d/ For those people using a *FIXED* release, make sure
      you announce any old version that are to be deleted
   e/ Announce how they will migrate from 1 version to another
   f/ CHECK https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/ECFLOW/Home
      Make sure fixed bugs are recorded/closed.
