0/ **** Check we are not in a high risk period ???

0/ **** DO ***NOT*** switch current link ****************
   **** User support will do this, during an arranged system session
   **** This is because we have member states, using it for their operations.
   
   **** If we have any scripts in production that are using 
   ****    /usr/local/apps/ecflow/current
   **** These make break.
   **** This is **very** important      
   **** IDEALLY we need to educate member states *NOT* to use 
   ****     /usr/local/apps/ecflow/current  

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0/ Inform user support, allows user support to test rpm
    
   
0/ *Before* each release, make sure the ecflow tar file is
   copied to $SCRATCH and inform Daniel. This will allow
   him to make rpm packages, build on other linux flavours.

   This is important, so that release, used internally is in
   sync with release given to users. 
   
   - ** Check the size of tar file **, ensure that have not included redundant files.
   <Inform Daniel>
   
0/ git flow release start 4.0.7

   *Push* branch onto stash, otherwise the we can not pull, from the remote machines
   - In eclipse, you *may* have to push this branch first
     Team->Push Branch
     *otherwise* the option Team->Push Upstream  may well be greyed out.

0/ Update ECFLOW_GIT_BRANCH to "release/4.0.7" in the nightly build.py

0/ For a PREPIFS release change file:
     /usr/local/apps/ecflow/.modulerc
   This file defines the mapping to symbol, i.e like default,new,old, prepifs
   
0/ Update Documentation
   
  - https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/ECFLOW/Change+History

  - Need automated way:
    - Just need to update python API.
    - cd $WK/Doc/online; make clean; make html
    
    Sometimes this crashes, Just re-build Pyext, and try again.
       rm -rf Pyext/bin
       bjam -j8
    
0/ CRAY: If you build on cct-login, then copy build to cca/ccb

         cd /usr/local/apps/ecflow
         scp -r 4.0.7 emos@cca:/usr/local/apps/ecflow/.
      
   READHAT: If we built on ecgb/redhat we can copy release to sappa/sappab 
  
         scp -r 4.0.7 emos@sappa:/usr/local/apps/ecflow/.
         scp -r 4.0.7 emos@sappb:/usr/local/apps/ecflow/.
      
   VIRTUAL Machines: These should treated like regular machines. 
         - These are based on opensuse113, hence we need top copy over exe for this
         
         - ssh opensuse113/lxab, su emos;
         - scp -r 4.0.7 emos@<virtual machine>:/usr/local/apps/ecflow/.
         
         
  *Make* sure destination has a trailing '/.' otherwise you
  can end up renaming.

0/ Inform RD, ask them to provide the list of virtual machines. 
   where they want the new release installed to:
   virtual machines are opensuse112, hence we use lxab(opensuse113) to copy from:
   
   ssh rdx@<hostname>
   
   i.e  ssh rdx@vecfrdda1
   
   The list of all virtual machines, versions and port numbers is:
   
        ~rdx/ecflow/servers.config
        
   - ssh opensuse113/lxab, su emos;
   - scp -r 4.0.7 emos@vecfrdda1:/usr/local/apps/ecflow/.
