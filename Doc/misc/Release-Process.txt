Process
==================================================================

0/ Inform Daniel. Place tar file on $SCRATCH, allow daniel to test all RPM

0/ git flow start release 4.0.5

   Push branch onto stash, otherwise the we can not pull, from the remote machines
   - In eclipse, you *may* have to push this branch first
     Team->Push Branch
     *otherwise* the option Team->Push Upstream  may well be greyed out.

0/ Update ECFLOW_GIT_BRANCH to  "release/4.0.5" 

0/ **** Check we are not in a high risk period ???

0/ **** DO ***NOT*** switch current link ****************
   **** User support will do this, during an arranged system session
   **** This is because we have member states, using it for their operations.
   
   **** If we have any scripts in production that are using 
   ****    /usr/local/apps/ecflow/current
   **** These make break.
   **** This is **very** important      
   **** IDEALLY we need to educate member states *NOT* to use 
   ****     /usr/local/apps/ecflow/current  

0/ Update Documentation
   
  - https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/ECFLOW/Change+History

  - Need automated way:
    - Just need to update python API.
    - cd $WK/Doc/online; make clean; make html
    
    Sometimes this crashes, Just re-build Pyext, and try again.
       rm -rf Pyext/bin
       bjam -j8
    
0/ CRAY: If you build on cct-login, then copy build to cca/ccb

         cd /usr/local/apps/ecflow
         scp -r 4.0.4 emos@cca:/usr/local/apps/ecflow/.
      
   READHAT: If we built on ecgb/readhat we can copy release to sappa/sappab 
  
         scp -r 4.0.4 emos@sappa:/usr/local/apps/ecflow/.
         scp -r 4.0.4 emos@sappb:/usr/local/apps/ecflow/.
      

*Make* sure destination has a trailing '/.' otherwise you
can end up renaming.

0/ *Before* each release, make sure the ecflow tar file is
   copied to $SCRATCH and inform Daniel. This will allow
   him to make rpm packages, build on other linux flavours.

   This is important, so that release, used internally is in
   sync with release given to users. 
   
   - ** Check the size of tar file **, ensure that have not included redundant files.
   <Inform Daniel>
