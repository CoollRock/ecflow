************************************************************
 VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT:
 Pre-announce release, because:
   a/ User support need to set up the modules on AIX
   b/ Daniel needs to pre-test it works on all other linux flavours
   c/ For those people who use current LINK, will be hosed
      They need warning and chance to prepare
   d/ For those people using a *FIXED* release, make sure
      you announce any old version that are to be deleted
   e/ Announce how they will migrate from 1 version to another
   f/ CHECK https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/ECFLOW/Home
      Make sure fixed bugs are recorded/closed.

0/ **** Check we are not in a high risk period ???

0/ **** DO ***NOT*** switch current link ****************
   **** User support will do this, during an arranged system session
   **** This is because we have member states, using it for their operations.
   
   **** If we have any scripts in production that are using 
   ****    /usr/local/apps/ecflow/current
   **** These make break.
   **** This is **very** important      
   **** IDEALLY we need to educate member states *NOT* to use 
   ****     /usr/local/apps/ecflow/current

         scp -r 4.0.2 emos@cca:/usr/local/apps/ecflow 
      
   READHAT: If we built on ecgb/readhat we can cop release to sappa/sappab 
  
         scp -r 4.0.2 emos@sappa:/usr/local/apps/ecflow/.
         scp -r 4.0.2 emos@sappb:/usr/local/apps/ecflow/.

        cd /usr/local/apps/ecflow
        ecrcp -avr 4.0.2 emos@c2b:/usr/local/apps/ecflow/.
 

*Make* sure destination has a trailing '/.' otherwise you
can end up renaming.

0/ *Before* each release, make sure the ecflow tar file is
   copied to $SCRATCH and inform Daniel. This will allow
   him to make rpm packages, build on other linux flavours.

   This is important, so that release, used internally is in
   sync with release given to users. 
   
   - ** Check the size of tar file **, ensure that have not included redundant files.
