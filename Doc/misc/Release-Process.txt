************************************************************
 VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT:
 Pre-announce release, because:
   a/ User support need to set up the modules on AIX
   b/ Daniel needs to pre-test it works on all other linux flavours
   c/ For those people who use current LINK, will be hosed
      They need warning and chance to prepare
   d/ For those people using a *FIXED* release, make sure
      you announce any old version that are to be deleted
   e/ Announce how they will migrate from 1 version to another
   f/ CHECK https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/ECFLOW/Home
      Make sure fixed bugs are recorded/closed.

Process
==================================================================

0/ git flow start release 4.0.5

   Push to branch onto stash, otherwise the we can not pull, from the remote machines
   - In eclipse, you *may* have to push this branch first
     Team->Push Branch
     *otherwise* the option Team->Push Upstream  may well be greyed out.

0/ **** Check we are not in a high risk period ???

0/ **** DO ***NOT*** switch current link ****************
   **** User support will do this, during an arranged system session
   **** This is because we have member states, using it for their operations.
   
   **** If we have any scripts in production that are using 
   ****    /usr/local/apps/ecflow/current
   **** These make break.
   **** This is **very** important      
   **** IDEALLY we need to educate member states *NOT* to use 
   ****     /usr/local/apps/ecflow/current  

0/ Update Documentation
   
  - https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/ECFLOW/Change+History

  - Need automated way:
    - Just need to update python API.
    - cd $WK/Doc/online; make clean; make html
    
    Sometimes this crashes, Just re-build Pyext, and try again.
       rm -rf Pyext/bin
       bjam -j8
    
0/ CRAY: If you build on cct-login, then copy build to cca.

         cd /usr/local/apps/ecflow
         scp -r 4.0.3 emos@cca:/usr/local/apps/ecflow/.
      
   READHAT: If we built on ecgb/readhat we can copy release to sappa/sappab 
  
         scp -r 4.0.3 emos@sappa:/usr/local/apps/ecflow/.
         scp -r 4.0.3 emos@sappb:/usr/local/apps/ecflow/.
      
   LXab:  copy -> LXOP (until we can build independently on LXOP)
   
         cd /usr/local/apps/ecflow
         scp -r 4.0.3 emos@lxop:/usr/local/apps/ecflow/. 
      

*Make* sure destination has a trailing '/.' otherwise you
can end up renaming.

0/ *Before* each release, make sure the ecflow tar file is
   copied to $SCRATCH and inform Daniel. This will allow
   him to make rpm packages, build on other linux flavours.

   This is important, so that release, used internally is in
   sync with release given to users. 
   
   - ** Check the size of tar file **, ensure that have not included redundant files.
   <Inform Daniel>
   
0/ Inform user support so that they can update the module functionality.
   This is mostly automated a part from c2a.
