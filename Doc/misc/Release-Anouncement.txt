To use a specific version (this is the *recommended* way):

   use ecflow
   
   This will setup the PATHS for client server and python extension
   Note: The GUI(ecflowview) is only available on linux  
   Please note that the latest version of ecflow can change at any
   time, so it is advisable to specify the version for long term usage.

To use the latest test version:

   export ECFLOW_VERSION=test
   use ecflow
   
To use the latest ecFlow CRAY(cct/cca),AIX(c2a/c2b) and redhat/RHEL(ecgb):

   Please use the module functionality  i.e
      module avail ecflow
      module unload ecflow 
      module load ecflow/4.0.2
                  
            
Compatibility
========================================================================
The client/Server from one release should not be mixed with another.
To avoid this problem it is *highly* recommended that you use a 
specific version:

   export ECFLOW_VERSION=4.0.2
   use ecflow

Additionally references to ecflow_client in the scripts(.ecf) should use
the server variable %ECF_VERSION% to locate the executable, this ensures
that client version is in sync with the server i.e

   /usr/local/apps/ecflow/%ECF_VERSION%/bin/ecflow_client --complete
   
or:

  module load ecflow/%ECF_VERSION%
