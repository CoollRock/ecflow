The release includes the following changes:

 4.0.0 : (production, November 2013)
   - ecflowview    : add %VARIABLE% syntax in ecflowview.menu
                     add Web Menu (second level access to manual, script, job, output)
                     add '.' as part of the task name to filter directory content in output window
                     add write ecflowview.menu menu
                     TimeLine accessible from Menu for server node and task node  
   - ecflowview    : logout-login fix
   - ecflowview    : Support to allow new clients to interact with old servers
   - ecflowview    : ECFLOW-71 error in ecflow on delete using GUID
   - ecflow_server : SUP-688 time and event dependency
   - ecflow_server : Change Force and Run commands, to work similar to SMS, they now advance the next time slot
   - ecflow_server : Abort followed by child 'complete', now treated as a zombie.
   - ecflow_server : Pre-processor: %%%% should be replaced with %%, and not %
   - ecflow_server : Fixed cron/time(with time series) on a family, once free should stay free, until re-queued
   - ecflow_server : SUP-681 ecflow_server crash. server_enviroment.cfg, should not have quotes for the value parts
   - ecflow_server : added 'alter change clock_sync', to allow suite calendar to sync with computer
   - ecflow_server : Updated kill and status commands, to automatically generate variables like ECF_RID. Allow 'kill' straight after checkpoint recovery.
   - ecflow_client : Updated suite definition parser, to allow suites to have labels
   - ecflow_client : Fix bug in the display of zombies. Action shown in log file did not match, command line display, when zombie attributes used.
   - ecflow_client : Updated zombie display, to prepend manual or automatic in front of action, i.e manual-fob.
                     This distinguishes between action taken by the user, from automatic action, especially when zombie attributes are used.
   - ecflow_client : Fix bug in --server_load, where suite paths were not extracted correctly
   - ecflow.so     : Added new python function to Node(find_node_up_the_tree()), to make it easier to add triggers.
   - *             : Fix --migrate bugs: to take into account label's that have new lines
   - *             : Fix --migrate bugs: (reading history with group commands, group separator ';' treated as newline 
                     in error during parse. DefsStructureParser.cpp)
   - *             : Migrated source control management from perforce to git, and updated build scripts
   - *             : Updated build scripts to allow compilation and regression tests on cray XC30
   - *             : switch to boost 1.53, and removed use of std::auto_ptr and replaced with boost:;shared_ptr in the tests
 
To use a specific version:

   export ECFLOW_VERSION=4.0.0
   use ecflow
   
To use the latest test version:

   export ECFLOW_VERSION=test
   use ecflow
   
To use the latest ecFlow on linux/HPUX/ecgate call:

   use ecflow
   
   This will setup the PATHS for client server and python extension
   Note: The GUI(ecflowview) is only available on linux and ecgate.
   Please note that the latest version of ecflow can change at any
   time, so it is advisable to specify the version for long term usage.

   On CRAY(cct),AIX(c2a/c2b) and redhat/RHEL(ecgb):

   Please use the module functionality  i.e
      module avail ecflow
      module unload ecflow 
      module load ecflow/4.0.0
                  
            
Compatibility
========================================================================
The client/Server from one release should not be mixed with another.
To avoid this problem it is *highly* recommended that you use a 
specific version:

   export ECFLOW_VERSION=4.0.0
   use ecflow

Additionally references to ecflow_client in the scripts(.ecf) should use
the server variable %ECF_VERSION% to locate the executable, this ensures
that client version is in sync with the server i.e

   /usr/local/apps/ecflow/%ECF_VERSION%/bin/ecflow_client --complete
