To use a specific version use the module functionality.
This will setup the PATHS for client server and python extension
Note: The GUI(ecflowview) is only available on linux  

   module avail ecflow
   module unload ecflow 
   module load ecflow/4.0.8
      
            
Compatibility
========================================================================
The client/Server from one release should not be mixed with another.
To avoid this problem it is *highly* recommended that you use a 
specific version:

   module load ecflow/4.0.8

Additionally references to ecflow_client in the scripts(.ecf) should use
the server variable %ECF_VERSION% to locate the executable, this ensures
that client version is in sync with the server i.e

   /usr/local/apps/ecflow/%ECF_VERSION%/bin/ecflow_client --complete
   
or:

  module load ecflow/%ECF_VERSION%
  ecflow_client --complete
