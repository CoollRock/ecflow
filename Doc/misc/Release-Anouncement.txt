   Please use the module functionality  i.e

      module unload ecflow 
      module load ecflow/4.0.0rc1
                  
            
Compatibility
========================================================================
The client/Server from one release should not be mixed with another.
To avoid this problem it is *highly* recommended that you use a 
specific version:

   export ECFLOW_VERSION=4.0.0rc1
   use ecflow

Additionally references to ecflow_client in the scripts(.ecf) should use
the server variable %ECF_VERSION% to locate the executable, this ensures
that client version is in sync with the server i.e

   /usr/local/apps/ecflow/%ECF_VERSION%/bin/ecflow_client --complete
