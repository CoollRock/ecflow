To use a specific version use the module functionality.
This will setup the PATHS for client server and python extension
Note: The GUI(ecflowview) is only available on linux  
Please note that the latest version of ecflow can change at any
time, so it is advisable to specify the version for long term usage.
i.e.

   module avail ecflow
   module unload ecflow 
   module load ecflow/4.0.7
      
Alternatively use:

   export ECFLOW_VERSION=4.0.7
   use ecflow
   
            
Compatibility
========================================================================
The client/Server from one release should not be mixed with another.
To avoid this problem it is *highly* recommended that you use a 
specific version:

   module load ecflow/4.0.7

Additionally references to ecflow_client in the scripts(.ecf) should use
the server variable %ECF_VERSION% to locate the executable, this ensures
that client version is in sync with the server i.e

   /usr/local/apps/ecflow/%ECF_VERSION%/bin/ecflow_client --complete
   
or:

  module load ecflow/%ECF_VERSION%
  ecflow_client --complete
