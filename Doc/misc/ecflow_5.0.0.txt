Reason to move to ecflow 5.0.0
====================================
o Built with c++11
  - issue for rpm, force update to gcc 4.7 minimum version
  
o Built with python3 
  - big implication for existing 2.7 code base

o Uses the latest boost version

o Allow family to be limited as well as tasks

o Functionality for archive and restore.( and auto migrate). 
  To cope with extra large suites

o much better identification of zombies
  - i.e password missmatch, pid miss match, 
    if user created zombies we record user command that 
    gave rise to the zombie
  
o security: password protection
o security: User commands will now log hostname as 
            well as the user that issued the command

o Improved why command, when using time attributes.

o New query command, allows us to query event,meter and trigger status.

o Old GUI(ecfowview) will be retired

o New Queue attribute
  This is still under developement
  
o new date attribute
  This is still under developement

o Replace boost serialsiation used client/server communication with json.
  (TODO)

* We will be producing a development version of ecflow 5.0.0
  It should *NOT* be used for any operational task, as it subject to change
  and can not gurantee compatibliy with future release, until released.
  
Challenges
=====================================================================
o In ecflow 4.70 the checkpoint is now saved, in the defs format.
  hence migrating to the new server should be trevial.
  
o However the client/server protocol has changed, 
  and hence we can *NOT* use 4.x.x ecflow_ui, to 
  view 5.x.x server, and vice versa.
  By replacing boost with json, it should allow greater 
  compatibility in the future.
