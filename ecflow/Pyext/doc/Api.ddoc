API
===

The default api is provided by the ecflow module.

However this API can be tailored to be more object oriented.

There can be two ways of using this API.
Lets assume we have specified this API in ecf.py

o The contents of ecf.py can be placed in
  __init__.py. So that whenever the user imports
  ecflow, the corresponding API is automatically available.
  
  + This is no confusion here.
  + the API will be versioned along with the extension.
  + tested
  - Hard wired, however it can still be updated by
    the user if required
  
o leave as a specific import:
  
  import ecf
  
  + Need a separate version.
  + more flexible
  - version mismatch between extension and API could arise
  - Need to test separately
