 Install steps
 =============
 
 0/ These Steps should be encapsulated by $WK/build/install.sh ***************
 
 1/ Become emos user. Required for write access to installation directory
    Note: 
         # su - emos 
         (uses a new environment) This is a good way of testing that the install environment has been set up
 
         # su emos
         Uses the current environment
         
    # su - emos
    
    You can invoke id: to confirm logged in as emos:
    i.e # id
    
 2/ Set the installation directory. The same on all platforms
    ECFLOW_INSTALL_DIR is used by bjam install
 
   # export ECFLOW_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/apps/sms/ecflow
   
 3/ Set BOOST_ROOT. Required since we need boost build and bjam.
 
    linux 32 : export BOOST_ROOT=/var/tmp/ma0/boost/boost_1_47_0
    linux 64 : export BOOST_ROOT=/vol/ecf/boost/boost_1_47_0
    hpux     : export BOOST_ROOT=/scratch/ma/emos/ma0/hpia64/boost/boost_1_47_0
    AIX      : export BOOST_ROOT=/s1a/emos_esuite/emos_data/sms/boost/boost_1_47_0
 
 4/ Change directory to ecflow root.
 
    linux 32 : cd /var/tmp/ma0/clientRoot/workspace/git/working-directory
    linux 64 : cd /vol/ecf/ecflow_1_9_0
    hpux     : cd /scratch/ma/emos/ma0/hpia64/ecflow_1_9_0
    AIX      : cd /s1a/emos_esuite/emos_data/sms/ecflow_1_9_0
 
 5/ Invoke the install, varies per platform:
    probably a good idea to keep bjam in $BOOST_ROOT as this will help install as emos
 
    Linux 32/64:
      Only install ecflow and ecflowview since we have x-windows on linux
 
      debug:    
         # $BOOST_ROOT/bjam -d2 install-all                
      
      release:  
         # $BOOST_ROOT/bjam -d2 variant=release install-all  
 
    HPUX:
      Only install ecflow
      debug:    
         # $BOOST_ROOT/bjam -d2 install  
      
      release:  
         # $BOOST_ROOT/bjam -d2 variant=release install  
    
    AIX:
      Only install ecflow
      We only have debug build. release does not work.
      * note use: # su emos since we need to set path to python libs *
      
         # $BOOST_ROOT/bjam -d2 install  

6/ Check file permissions.
   The file files are copied with emos umask. 
   Hence the file permissions may need changing:

   chmod 755 $ECFLOW_INSTALL_DIR/bin/*

==============================================================================

o Please note that oetzi/ma0 has been added to the .rhosts file

  so we can also install as:
  
      rsh emos@lxa "bjam -d2 install"
