Project
==========================================================================

o Overheads
   => ecflow  20%   /user support/bug-fix/release/qa/install etc, overhead
   => Operational use of ecflow in 40r2 ~April 2014  
   => Migration of ecflow to cray, Update local job scheduling scripts
   => Prodgen New streams/destination, issues 10% this should be going
   => metview/magic  ? overhead
   => project management
  
o Software
   => Intel Vtune Amplifier, & integration into regression test suite
   
o Training
   => prince
   => Multi-threading
   
o Project RISKS 
- Project board ? 
- Expectations/time-lines/schedule/ scope
- Separate project or Integrated into current ecflow ? 
  => Integrate into existing ecflow
- New Viewer, do we release this separately, or tie with ecflow
  => My own viewpoint is that we need to release together.
     because:
      - reduce maintainance overhead for us and our users
      - single install
      - Easier for end clients,

- Collate people willing to give regular feedback(Axel,Research) 
- Collate people willing to QA/test ( from developers )


o Progress and issue Reporting(agree) 
- Development methodology(Waterfall <--> Scrum) 
- Mock ups versus prototypes ?
- status, risks 
- regular code reviews. 
- feature demos (functionality, tests) 
- feature ease of uses( user feedback, from conducted tests)
- QA(make prototypes available to ops, research, operators) 
- Confluence/Jira 
- ** decide on platforms( linux,cray ? ) 
- ** decide on compilers( all, GNU,INTEL,CRAY) 
- Continuous Integration ecflow/bamboo
